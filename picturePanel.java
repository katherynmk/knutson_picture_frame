 * A descendant of JPanel that has a BufferedImage object called picture as a private
 * data member as well as a setPicture function that takes in a
 * BufferedImage object to set picture to. When setPicture changes the value of the picture
 * private data member, it calls repaint, so that PicturePanel's paintComponent function
 * renders the new image
