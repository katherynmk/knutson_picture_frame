 * A JFrame descendant. It should be 290 pixels wide and 400 pixels
 * tall. It should use a BorderLayout to arrange the controls as shown in the examples above.
 * The north part should be occupied by a PicturePanel. The center of the PictureFrame should
 * consist of a JPanel that likewise uses a BorderLayout, with its north section filled with a
 * JTextField for holding the date, its center section filled with the description JTextArea, and its
 * south section filled with a JPanel that holds the three buttons.
