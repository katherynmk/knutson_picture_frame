Mike and Zac over two days spent a combined probably 6 hours. Zac helped both of us A LOT. He deserves a ton of credit
While he gave us 0 code to copy, he helped us write it how he did in a combination with how we wrote it ourselves 

This project was hard :( 
I started work right as this project was released and my hands are killing my.
RIP Katie's hands, may they go on to a better keyboard someday....

Please refer to the tutoring classroom png so see us all sitting in our virtual classroom

ALSO
The Code doesnt cycle around..........
You get the pictures you get :(
